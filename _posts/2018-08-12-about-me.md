I decided that almost no one will donate or contribute if I don't tell a little about my self first. To get to know me a little better you must first know my age. I am a **14 year old** programmer residing in the United States (the state of which I will keep secret for now). Since I am 14 and I can not get a job (legally) in my state and my parents don't really want to donate right now I require donations.

If you are wondering about my programming abilities or hobbies you must know I have been programming for **four years**. I like **hunting**, **designing**, and (obviously) **programming**. I spend most of my time doing school (I am learning French right now for the **9th grade**) but for an hour after school I have a computer time and I use that to make my projects. On the weekends I have more time (from 10AM to 8PM) to use computers although I don't just use it for 10 hours straight.

I don't play many videogames (mostly mobile FPS for a few minutes a day). When I do play videogames sometimes I use my programming skills to get an advantage (don't blame me, if you had wicked skills and sucked at game you would too). These "advantages" usually earn me the name "IceHacks" in most games. I don't do anything malicious so that's a **+1**.
