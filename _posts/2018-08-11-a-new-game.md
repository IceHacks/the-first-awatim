With the popularity growth of "io games" I decided to make one myself although I do know that _some_ - erhm - "people" don't like these new internet games. So I decided I would make a game that satified the tastes of all gamers. An "io game" so good it could be a "real" game. The game idea is simple but I won't talk much about that right now. Patrons get secret leaks so you should check out that (not advertising).

For more info on this game and more (that may be) like it follow [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/thefirstawatim) or become a patron on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/AWATIM). Thanks for reading make sure to check back every now and then!
