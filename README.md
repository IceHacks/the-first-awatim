## Games
We believe in free games with no ads and minimal IAP's. That is hard for most developers to conceive but not for us. Being a hardcore programmer myself and an mild gamer I "understand" ads but I disagree with them at the same time. The best way to get rid of ads is through nice people (maybe you) that donate and I realize that struggle.
